Experiments with Key Storage (OBK)
==================================

The H5 serie contains flash blocks dedicated to security key storage. In
theory, this keys can be used for any application but when some other
security features are enabled, some keys have a pre-defined purpose.

The goal of `test_obk` is to explore some security features of H5.

Debug Authentication with password
----------------------------------

As a first step, test the DA with password. The password authentication
method can be used **ONLY WHEN TrustZone IS DISABLED** :
 - Disable TZ of the target by calling `make tz_dis`
 - Set USE_SEC to "n" into the Makefile to use non-secure memory map
 - make, and load desired firmware (for example with TEST_OBK directive)

1) Set the MCU PRODUCT_STATE to PROVISIONING

A macro to modify state is available into the mcu_config gdb script (set_st)
and the makefile script contains a shortcut : `make st_prov`

An alternate solution is to use the ST tool :
`STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -ob PRODUCT_STATE=0x17`

2) Create an OBK file

For the moment, i've use the official STM32Cube tools because i've not found
enough documentation to do the whole process with custom tools (not yet :p)
The TrustedPackageCreator use an XML file as input and create a binary OBK
file, below the command to use:
```STM32TrustedPackageCreator_CLI â€“obk scripts/da_password.xml```

3) Load the password into iRoT sector (load OBK)

```STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -sdp scripts/da_password.obk```

4) Update PRODUCT_STATE to CLOSED

When the device is in PROVISIONING state the firmware is not executed. According
to reference manual, root secutiry service (RSS) is used. After provisioning a
password, the product state must be modified to upper level to allow firmware to
be started again.

A macro to modify state is available into the mcu_config gdb script (set_st)
and the makefile script contains a shortcut : `make st_closed`

An alternate solution is to use the ST tool :
`STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -ob PRODUCT_STATE=0x72`

5) Do a regression to revert to OPEN (bulk erase)

Here again, i've not find enough documentation to do a regression without ST
tools.

First, try to discover target :
```STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG debugauth=2```

Then, do the regression. Below command ask for a password file who have been
produced during step 2 with the OBK file.
```STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG debugauth=1```
